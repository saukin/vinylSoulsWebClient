# vinylSoulsWebClient
study project - rest, jsf, files, maven, payara, cdi


This is my study project representing my basic skills in java ee, jsf, payara server, maven and writing/editing local doc-files.
It is a web application that uses vinylSoulsServer api to get information and functionality. 
It provides:
- creating a profile;
- creating, editing, viewing and deleting (inactivating) records;
There're two modes of using it: logged in and unlogged in. Being unlogged it is possible only to view information  (no possibilities to change and create any records). And being logged in it's possible to use full functionality including viewing records of other users.


To launch it please do next actions:

1. clone the project to your ide
2. start payara server
3. run the project with maven
4. run the project with any of following browsers: chrome, opera, mozilla, yandex, edge or safary (on apple devices).
5. use the webapp.

you can see logins and passwords in database provided with vinylSoulsServer.
also you can find some images for creating new albums in XS_webApp/src//main/webapp/resources/posters folder.


Any comments about the application and its implementations are very welcome!

Thank you!
